# Approximation of Game Specification using Manually Generate Data points 
Neural Network can be used to approximate all sorts of points, even if the points it predicts is wrong, it still outputs 
something, and that is the most important feature we are going to use. Imagine we have a series of data points, and those 
data points are manually created to suit a specific game function that we use, then we can create a neural network to 
approximate it, and use that trained neural network as our function. Eventually, we have trained specific neural network
that will eventually do what we want to do
$x_6 = \dfrac{1}{x}$
