<h1>Approximation of Game Specification using Manually Generate Data points</h1>
<p>Problem Description: To create a mathematical function in a video game to model some behaviour is not easy from our experience, there might be some method that the industry has been using that we might not know. However, from our experience, it is hard to find the perfect function that describe exactly the dynamic of the game functions that we want.</p>

Solution: 
Neural Network can be used to approximate all sorts of points, even if the points it predicts is wrong, it still outputs 
something, and that is the most important feature we are going to use. Imagine we have a series of data points, and those 
data points are manually created to suit a specific game function that we use, then we can create a neural network to 
approximate it, and use that trained neural network as our function. Eventually, we have trained specific neural network
that will eventually do what we want to do
$x_6 = \dfrac{1}{x}$
